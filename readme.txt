COP3504C - Project 1: RLE with Images
Overview: In this project students will develop routines to encode and decode data for images using run-length encoding
          (RLE). Students will implement encoding and decoding of raw data, conversion between data and strings, and
          display of information by creating procedures that can be called from within their programs and externally.
          This project will give students practice with loops, strings, arrays, methods, and type-casting
